BEAVERWHALE115_DESC_desc:0 "Beaverwhale115 has been the king of Canver ever since it was established  and the countries citizens always followed him, but now his powers slowly starts to fade. Beaverwhale115 is met with a different choice, either subjugate his nation to the will of SU, the dominant power of the Western Hemisphere, or subjugate the nation to a revolution. If Beaverwhale115 wants to remain the king, he will have to tread carefully."

BEAVERWHALE115_DESC_desc:0 "Beaverwhale115 has made his choice, subjugated by the Southern Union, Canver is now safe, but at what cost? Altough the opposition seemed to die down, Beaverwhale115 does not see everywhere and as such, he is afraid of the shadows. Will Beaverwhale115 be able to break free of SU, or stay a mere puppet of others, or worse yet, fall to a revolution? Only Beaverwhale115s future actions will tell."

ALEX_HORNE_DESC_desc:0 "Ever since the king turned to SU, Alex_Horne has grown disgruntled with the though of social democracy, as it failed to lead a revolution, and now openly preaches the thought of Marxism. Finally, when the king was in the most vulnerable position, Alex_Horne got his way and lead a coup de ta that succeded! With the workers freed, only one goal remains- seek revenge on the SU!"
