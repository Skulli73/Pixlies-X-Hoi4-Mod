SIXDIN0_DESC_desc:0 "SixDin0 is the rightful ruler of Yorkshire, as dictated by the inheritance of the throne, that his father once ruled on. SixDin0 however barely started his rule and coup ocurred by the Yorkshirian Clan, a power hungry entity that would do anything to get the hold on Yorkshires rule. SixDin0 however managed to stop the coup, this in turn however lead to SixDin0 becoming more authoritarian. This however harms the nation and if something will not be done the Yorkshire clan could have a chance at coup once more. Will SixDin0 change his way to avoid certain doom or will SixDin0s ways stay the same and face the certain doom? We can say anything with certainty, only that the nations fate lies on SixDin0s arms."

SIXDIN0__DESC_desc:0 "SixDin0 had realised that his authoritarian ways were flawed and as such he reformed the system into a Constituonal monarchy, where the people would vote for their own good. Hopefully this will be enough to stave off the midnight. Hopefully it will also be the thing needed to finally rid the country of the Yorkshirian clan. However this new system will turn out, SixDin0  is ready to face it."

CALCULORD_DESC_desc:0 "Calculord realised that it didnt matter where the clan would use the nationalist rhetoric or socialistic one, either way, the Yorkshirian clan would finally rule Yorkshire and brought the deserved prosperity. The Nationalist side however ensures that Calculord is free to try conquering neighboring lands as he pleases, as to realise the dream of Greater Yorkshire."

The socialist ideology however seems like a the worst one to Calculord, as he needs to ensure the well being of workers, or does he? Either way, Calculord is trying to prepare the country for the liberation of other workers."
