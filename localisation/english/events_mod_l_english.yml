demo.01.d:0 "It has over the time become clear that our alliance with the Southern Union was nothing more than an Alliance of Conveinience.

gge.1.t:0 "Ruling Coalition Collapses"
gge.1.d:0 "After Blitz was voted out of the office of Prime Minister by the National Assembly upon Southern Aggression towards the Germanic Empire and suspected collaboration with the Southern Union by him, a coalition out of all parties was formed and backed Skulli as Prime Minister until the war with the Southern Union was won. This term seemed to first have been successful with the military industry successfully advancing and the country being more and more prepared for the war and the efforts seemed to work when the first part of the Invasion by the Southern Union was successfully defeated and the Southern Union suffered heavy casualities. Unfortunately for us, the Southern Union was able to regroup and later defeat us and most of the blame for this is layed on Prime Minister and Head of the Armed Forces Skulli73. Due to this failiure, multiple parties in the all-party government now see Prime Minister Skulli as unfit to lead the country and have withdrawn support from the Prime Minister. It is now unsure whether the government still has the confidence of the National Assembly. In addition to this many cabinet members, especially of those parties that withdrew from the coalition, have given their resignation to the Emperor and it seems as if the Government is collapsing."
